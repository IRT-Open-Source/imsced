# imscED

imscED is an editor for the subtitles and caption format
[IMSC](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml-imsc1/). It shows how
[imscJS](https://github.com/sandflow/imscJS) from Pierre Lemieux can be used
to manipulate style attributes from an parsed IMSC document and how to export
it back to XML.

Note that this project is a pre-alpha release for developer review. It is
a prototype in development and can change at any time. The code does not
represent a public API.

Therefore it is not ready for production and use it at your own risk.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# You need to copy index.html and the following directories to your
# production environment:
# * data (initial sample video and subtitle file for testing)
# * dist (build JS files)

```
